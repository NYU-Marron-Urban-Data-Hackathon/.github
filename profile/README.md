# NYU Marron’s Urban Data Hackathon

NYU Marron is excited to announce its first Urban Data Hackathon for NYU students. Please join us in using data and analytics to take on critical challenges of urban living. 

Cities are central to economic development and the entrepreneurial and technological advances that improve the human condition. But urban density has a downside—it can exacerbate pollution, overburden infrastructure and public services, and increase the potential for crime and violence. 

We invite undergraduate and graduate NYU students of all backgrounds. You will have a chance to work on problems Marron Institute researchers address, such as city-services equity, urban air quality and climate, urban expansion, criminal justice, transit infrastructure, and many more, using various types of urban data.

**When:** November 4 — November 9

**Where:**  

* Hackathon kick-off Event: November 4 at 5:00 PM EST  / Online
* Finalists’ Presentations:  November 8 4:00 PM EST /370 Jay Street, 12th Fl, Brooklyn, NY, 11201, Seminar Room 1201 
* Awards Presentation: November 9 at 3:00 PM EST / 370 Jay Street, 12th Fl, Brooklyn, NY, 11201, Seminar Room 1201

**Eligibility for submission:** NYU undergraduate and graduate students are welcome, but current or former Marron student employees are ineligible.

**Prizes:** The winning teams will be invited to attend a Marron-hosted event on November 9 where prizes will be awarded for the best projects totalling up to $3,000.
