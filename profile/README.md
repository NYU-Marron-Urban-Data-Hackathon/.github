# NYU Marron’s Urban Data Hackathon

NYU Marron is excited to announce its first Urban Data Hackathon for NYU students. Please join us in using data and analytics to take on critical challenges of urban living. 

Cities are central to economic development and the entrepreneurial and technological advances that improve the human condition. But urban density has a downside—it can exacerbate pollution, overburden infrastructure and public services, and increase the potential for crime and violence. 

We invite undergraduate and graduate NYU students of all backgrounds. You will have a chance to work on problems Marron Institute researchers address, such as city-services equity, urban air quality and climate, urban expansion, criminal justice, transit infrastructure, and many more, using various types of urban data.

**When:** November 4 — November 9

**Where:**  

* Hackathon kick-off Event: November 4 at 5:00 PM EDT  / Online
* Finalists’ Presentations:  November 8 4:00 PM EST /370 Jay Street, 12th Fl, Brooklyn, NY, 11201, Seminar Room 1201 
* Awards Presentation: November 9 at 3:00 PM EST / 370 Jay Street, 12th Fl, Brooklyn, NY, 11201, Seminar Room 1201

**Eligibility for submission:** NYU undergraduate and graduate students are welcome, but current or former Marron student employees are ineligible.

**Registration deadline:** Friday, November 4, 2022, 3:00 PM EDT

**Project submission deadline:** Monday, November 7, 2022, 11:59 PM EST

**Prizes:** The winning teams will be invited to attend a Marron-hosted event on November 9 where prizes will be awarded for the best projects totalling up to $3,000.

# About Marron Institute

The [NYU Marron Institute of Urban Management](https://marroninstitute.nyu.edu) conducts innovative applied research, working with cities to take on critical challenges of urban living. Started with a generous gift from Donald B. Marron, the Institute operates on a model of academic venture capital in which the faculty who run research programs receive seed funding. Faculty members use seed funds to develop their programs, hire research staff and build portfolios of externally-funded projects that have the potential to improve outcomes in cities. Currently, the Marron Institute has five major research programs focused on [urban planning](https://marroninstitute.nyu.edu/programs/urban-expansion), [environmental health](https://marroninstitute.nyu.edu/programs/health-environment-and-policy), [civic analytics](https://marroninstitute.nyu.edu/programs/civic-analytics), [transportation and land use](https://marroninstitute.nyu.edu/programs/transportation-and-land-use), and [public sector performance and innovation](https://marroninstitute.nyu.edu/programs/litmus).

# Project themes

### [Co-City Baton Rouge](https://marroninstitute.nyu.edu/initiatives/co-city-baton-rouge)
**About** The Co-City Baton Rouge (CCBR) initiative, led by Clayton Gillette, supports collaborative and cooperative self-governing institutions through community engagement to revitalize the economy in the Plank Road Corridor of Baton Rouge. 

**Example Problems:**
- ***How to visualize the locational efficiency of landbank properties in the Plank Road Corridor of Baton Rouge, Louisiana?***

Co-City Baton Rouge has established the Plank Road Community Land Bank and Trust, a novel institution based on a shared equity model to put vacant/abandoned/deteriorated properties within the land bank of Build Baton Rouge (redevelopment authority of EBR Parish) into productive use. We want to evaluate the properties currently in the land bank and determine which ones should be migrated to the PR CLBT based on the highest probability of being put back into active commerce.
